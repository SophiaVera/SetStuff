Introduction:
The following project contains the implementation of the eleven methods found on CodingBat in setstuff.  This includes ret17, zerothElement, contains, anyContains, union, intersect, nearestUnvisitedNode, listify, addEdge, collectNodes, and setInfinity.
Fulfillment of Specifications:
All of the methods here passed CodingBat's trials.  This means that for a substantial amount of trials, including test cases, the methods worked.
Errors:
Even though these methods worked on CodingBat, it is still possible that there could be an error.  There also might be more concise ways of writing these methods
Overview:
The structure of this code is fairly simple: its simply a collection of methods.  They are not dependent on each other to run.
Major Challenge:
My greatest challenge was probably interpreting what the instruction to each problem actually meant.  Some of then were somewhat abstract
Acknowledgments:
I found the prompt for nearestUnvisitedNode kind of confusing, so I worked with the people who sit around me to solve it. This included Amelia and Elyssa.
